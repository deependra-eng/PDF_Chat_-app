# Chat_with_PDF Demo

**Objective**: The primary goal of this project is to build an interactive application that allows users to ask questions based on the content of a set of PDF documents. The application leverages language models, vector embeddings, and document retrieval techniques to provide accurate and context-based answers.

**Data Sources**: The application uses PDF documents stored in a directory. These documents are loaded and processed to enable question answering based on their content.

**Libraries**: Streamlit, Langchain, GROQ.

**Steps Performed**:

1.Set environment variables for API keys & Initialize the Streamlit application with a title.

2.Initialize the ChatGroq language model with an API key and model name.

3.Define a prompt template that instructs the language model to answer questions based on the provided document context.

4.Created Vector Embedding Function:
>Check if vector embeddings are already stored in the session state.
>Load PDF documents from the specified directory.
>Split the documents into chunks of manageable size.
>Generate vector embeddings for the document chunks using Cohere embeddings.
>Store the embeddings in a FAISS vector store.

5.User Input Handling:
>Take user input for a question related to the documents.
>On button click, generate vector embeddings if not already done.
>Create a document chain for combining document text.
>Retrieve relevant document chunks using the stored vector embeddings.
>Invoke the retrieval chain to generate an answer based on the user's question.

6.Display Results:
>Display the answer generated by the language model.
>Use a Streamlit expander to show relevant document chunks for transparency.

**Outcome**: The application successfully allows users to ask questions based on the content of a set of PDF documents. It provides accurate, context-based answers and displays relevant document chunks, enhancing the user's understanding of how the answer was derived. The use of Streamlit ensures a user-friendly interface, while the integration of various libraries enables efficient document processing, embedding, and retrieval.
